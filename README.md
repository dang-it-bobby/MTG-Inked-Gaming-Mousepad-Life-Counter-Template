# MTG-Inked-Gaming-Mousepad-Life-Counter-Template
Three photoshop templates for 1 and 2 player MTG life counters.

The template I started off with is the one for [Inked Gaming's Custom Classic 9x8 mousepad](https://www.inkedgaming.com/products/custom-mousepad), all I did was add some numbers and circles to it.

Feel free to edit or do whatever you want with the files.

You can use [this site](https://www.rgb2cmyk.org/) to get a good idea of what the final product will look like, since they use a CMYK printer to print the mousepad out

Happy gaming!
